## 🧠 Overview  

**Koha Library Software** is a powerful open-source system used by libraries around the world to manage cataloging, circulation, patron accounts, acquisitions, and reporting. It is designed to support both small community libraries and large institutional collections with flexibility and scalability.

Koha provides a web-based interface that allows librarians and users to interact with the system from any compatible browser. Its modular architecture enables customization of workflows, modules, and user permissions, making it adaptable to a wide range of library environments.

While Koha itself runs on a server environment, many administrators and support tools can be accessed through Windows platforms, ensuring seamless daily management.
